## Pipeline Architecture

The workflow is structured into two main components: segmentation quality control and clustering-based phenotypic characterization.



### I. Segmentation Quality Control

> **Problem:** How can the reliability of automated segmentation in biological tissues be quantitatively assessed?

This module, detailed in [`Test of segmentation.md`](Test%20of%20segmentation.md), includes:

- **Standardization**: Conversion of complex ROI structures (Fiji) into programmatically usable binary masks.  
- **Fidelity Analysis**: Comparative evaluation using the **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test** to identify the most accurate segmentation method.  
- **Isolation Forest**: Detection of artefacts and aberrant segmentations through multidimensional anomaly detection.  
- **Recommendation Engineering**: Application of **Mann–Whitney U tests** to guide parameter optimization (e.g., smoothing, sensitivity).

### II. Unsupervised Phenotypic Characterization

> **Problem:** How can clustering validity be ensured in large and heterogeneous cellular populations?

The protocol described in [`Comparison of clusters.md`](Comparison%20of%20clusters.md) includes:

- **Clusterability Assessment**: Use of the **Hopkins statistic** to validate the presence of inherent structure prior to clustering.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Projection preserving 90% of protein variance.  
- **Automatic K Selection**: Consensus strategy combining **Silhouette**, **Davies–Bouldin**, and **Calinski–Harabasz** indices.  
- **Stability Analysis (ARI)**: Robustness evaluation via 80% bootstrapping using the **Adjusted Rand Index**.
